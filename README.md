## Rubocop

To use Rubocop locally, clone this repo and symlink to ~/.rubocop.yml. E.g.:

```
ln -s ~/repos/config/rubocop.yml ~/.rubocop.yml
```

Then, ensure you have Rubocop installed for each of your projects' Ruby versions. I also recommend using an editor plugin rather than running Rubocop yourself.
